Over the last few weeks I have been steadily working away (mostly when time and motivation were at my disposal) at moving away from [Linode](http://linode.com) to a VPS hosted by [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com).

There have been many reasons for this; Worry and lack of handling with Linode over their last huge DDOS outage - one in a long line of them, moving away from [Slackware](http://slackware.com) since most of my current work seems to be based around [Debian](http://debian.org) and [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com) based machines with [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com).

Of course, there is also a financial factor into this and while I probably could have downgraded to a cheaper Linode, this move is also about taking my own control for what I use, rather then through a third way agreement that was in place.

As part of this migration - I have decided to actually do a little more with my VPS then just sitting around as a bounce off host for IRC. So with a bit of help from a friend, I have started this 'ghost' blog (named after the software, not the spooky kind).

Probably in time, I will fade out my [old blog](michielvwessem.wordpress.com) on wordpress. After years working with wordpress, I have come to find it being being convoluted and sluggish in most cases.

So on wards and upwards then ... there are a few things left to do. The most important is to get a wiki up and I am planning to do that in probably (read most likely) a [docker](http://www.docker.com) container.

I also want to extend this blog a little bit, have perhaps a nicer theme (although the default casper theme is rather nice and clean) and some other little tweaks.

But that is for the future.
