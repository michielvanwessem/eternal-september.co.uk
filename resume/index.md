#### Profile

I am an experienced server/system administrator with experience of Linux Server maintenance and security, working with Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Red Hat Linux. In my role at Adaptive I gained experience with deploying scalable, high availability solutions for both my employer, as well as clients, advising them on how to apply new technology, as well as keeping them appraised of methods to help them lower their total cost of ownership.

During my time at Hive Online and Hive IP Ltd, I have build on that knowledge, moving their entire platform from Rackspace over Amazon Web Services, creating a more cost effective and stable infrastructure. Over the years working with Amazon Web Services I have come to love the flexibility and the range of tools that Amazon provides for hosting platforms. 

In my current role as system-administrator (previously as an DevOps-Engineer) my focus is largely aimed at the Operations side of the business. On a day to day basis, I work closely with a small group of Python and Django developers, supporting them in rolling out and setting up servers with bespoke written tools. The platform runs a combination of nginx, celery service, and a MySQL backend, with either RabbitMQ or AWS SQS. As of late, I have found myself taking more project orientated tasks, including keeping track of project schedules, as well as dealing more with clients on a day to day basis.

Our client solutions are hosted within cloud based environments either in Amazon Web Services, or Rackspace Cloud. I work closely with our developers and project management teams to ensure the servers are deployed in a timely fashion, maintain them while running, and remove them when our clientâ€™s promotion has ended.

Part of my remit when taking this role was to move our current infrastructure from Rackspace into Amazon Web Services, to deliver a more efficient, cost-effective and competitive hosting solution for their web services, adapting the solutions where needed to best suit their needs.

In previous roles, I have worked with traditional LAMP stacks and supported Drupal developers. As a systems administrator, I ensure that the technical infrastructure is continually stable and secure. This includes disaster recovery, patching and securing access, backups, automation, documenting and continuous monitoring of the infrastructure, as well as out of hours support.

For future roles, I would like to increase my knowledge and understanding of Amazon Web Services and build upon my existing experiences. Aside from that I have developed an interest in technical project management roles and would love to branch myself out in that direction, all the while keeping my technical expertise on par. In brief, I am an eager, motivated and multi-disciplined person, that loves to learn and is interested in following the process from the stages of design, through planning and detailing, to the successful completion.
