Since I am notoriously bad for remebering what kind of things I really want to have, doubly so when the time for things like Christmas, my birthday or anything else comes around, I have decided to keep a wish list of sorts.

Mostly because this means a lot less hassle for people who want to give me something rather then money, and part because I actually contains things I actively want to have.

Or ... as [Elizabeth](http://historygeek.co.uk/) told me:
*[...] and actually you are not so bad at knowing what you want, as knowing what you DON'T want and hating surprises. Only (most of the time) you don't know what you don't want until you see it, hence hating surprises. (sic)*
