This post came 


It's a fairly minimal set really.   For my book(s) I use a [start bay notebook](https://www.startbaynotebooks.co.uk/) cover in A5, with 4 printed notebooks, of which currently I really only use two:

Book two is project work mostly; where I dot down any thoughts about my current and future projects. Dates, things I need to work on, things to think off. By and large a slightly ordered brain-dump really to offload having to remember that
I use

I have a few set pages that I copy over every month, and obviously the largest part is taken up by the daily log, at the moment as page per day, except for Saturday/Sunday:

* Important dates
* Upcoming Projects
* Future to-do log
* Future research
* Monthly Planning
* Brain-dump and notes
* Daily log

Difference between Important dates and Upcoming projects is that dates can be anything from  meetings, to drinks, where projects are specifically kept to timelines set for server commissions or scuppering.

The Future to-do log is the biggest problem which has a chance to increase in an neverending-list-doom; luckily so far it remains within a page (just).

Monthly planning is the next month and a half laid out with 2 lines per day of what is needed to do, mostly so I have a slightly better visual overview then then either of the date-pages.

For the daily log, I pretty much use the standard bullet journal identifiers, only slightly difference is that on the right hand side, I user an "hour" to visually set-aside worked/blocked hours etc.
