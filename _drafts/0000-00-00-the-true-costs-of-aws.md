The true cost of AWS: 
(In Pints.)

This has been coming a while. Originally a joke that happened at [Adaptive](http://www.adaptive.co.uk), between my [colleague](https://xan-manning.co.uk), and me. The question was what a certain amount of storage in S3, if memory serves me correctly it was several hundreds of megabytes.

From this came the idea that we should write a blog post about AWS, highlighting what the cost of AWS would be, but then expressed in the universal language of pints.
