### What is the meaning of Eternal September?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Eternal September, which also goes by the name of "the *September that never ended*":

One of the seasonal rhythms of the Usenet used to be the annual September influx of clueless newbies who, lacking any sense of netiquette, made a general nuisance of themselves. This coincided with people starting college, getting their first internet accounts, and plunging in without bothering to learn what was acceptable. These relatively small drafts of newbies could be assimilated within a few months. 

This however changed in September 1993, when the internet provider America OnLine (AOL) subscribers gained access to Usenet (priorly having been more te domain of universities) and people where able to post from their home accounts. This nearly overwhelmed the 'old-timers' capacity to acculturate them; to those who nostalgically recall the period before, this triggered an inexorable decline in the quality of discussions on newsgroups. 

Syn. Eternal September.
